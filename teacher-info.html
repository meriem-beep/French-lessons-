    <p><strong>A description is just makeup. Let's meet so you can make your own description of me.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Oh, wait, apparently I need to write something ðŸ™„</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ok, so I'm 32 years old, I speak French, Arabic, English, German, and a little Spanish.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>I hold a degree in English literature and Anglo-Saxon studies.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Passionate about writing, especially fiction.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>I love playing basketball and traveling.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>I don't know what made you choose French (you absolutely must tell me), but as Duffy said in her song Mercy, I don't know what you're doing, but you're doing it well.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>I also love reading, or just buying books and stocking them without reading them. I just enjoy the feeling of having them by my side.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>

    <p class="questions"><strong>What is the easiest way to learn French in Vienna?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The best approach depends on the student's level. If they are a beginner, it's better to combine learning and pronunciation in the lessons, never separately.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Pronunciation is key in learning French. Being able to pronounce correctly from the beginning gives the student more confidence.</strong></p>
