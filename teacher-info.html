    <p>A description is just makeup. Let's meet so you can make your own description of me.</p>
    <p>Oh, wait, apparently I need to write something ðŸ™„</p>
    <p>Ok, so I'm 32 years old, I speak French, Arabic, English, German, and a little Spanish.</p>
    <p>I hold a degree in English literature and Anglo-Saxon studies.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Passionate about writing, especially fiction.</li>
        <li>I love playing basketball and traveling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I don't know what made you choose French (you absolutely must tell me), but as Duffy said in her song Mercy, I don't know what you're doing, but you're doing it well.</p>
    <p>I also love reading, or just buying books and stocking them without reading them. I just enjoy the feeling of having them by my side.</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
